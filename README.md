# Task List Management Project

This is a personal project built using **React**, **Vite**, and **TypeScript**. The goal of this project is to improve and train my skills in **Redux** and **Material UI** by developing a task list management application.

## Features

- Manage tasks with titles and frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Edit, add, and remove tasks
- Mark tasks as completed for the day
- Responsive UI built with **Material UI**
- State management using **Redux Toolkit**

## Tech Stack

- **React** (with Vite for fast development)
- **TypeScript** (for type-safe code)
- **Redux Toolkit** (for managing application state)
- **Material UI** (for building the user interface)

## Learning Goals

- Deepen my understanding of **Redux** for state management in React applications
- Gain experience using **Material UI** for building responsive and accessible UIs
- Learn how to integrate **TypeScript** effectively into a React project
